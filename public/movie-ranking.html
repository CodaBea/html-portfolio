<h1>The Best Movies According to Beth</h1>
<h2>My favourite movies of all time </h2>
<hr>
<h3>Murder on the Orient Express</h3>
<p>I thought this film was really good, you have no idea who the murderer is until the very end of the film. 
</p>
<h3>The Royal Tennenbaums</h3>
<p>I enjoyed the humour in this movie, I would like to watch more Wes Anderson movies.

<h3>Big Momma's House</h3>
<p>Really funny movie with some laughs. </p>
